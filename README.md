- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App)**  
  Explored web application vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.  

- **Mr. Robot VM Challenge**  
  Simulated privilege escalation and incident response in a themed environment.  

- **Security Onion Integration**  
  Built a monitoring VM to detect and respond to attacks within my lab network.

## 📓 Cyber Lab Journal
I maintain a structured journal for each experiment:
- **Objective:** What I set out to learn or test.  
- **Setup:** VM configurations, tools installed.  
- **Procedure:** Step-by-step actions with screenshots.  
- **Findings:** Evidence collected, anomalies detected.  
- **Reflection:** Lessons learned and parallels to real-world incident response.
